Website made for recrutation for Front-end Developer position, backend part is not touched by me.
Task done by Oliwier Orlik

Website extends the expectations with adding custom inputs (it seemed right to add those)

### Insights

1. Data provided is not varied, many dates are the same and flights are basicaly from Amsterdam to Barcelona or vice versa
   For better experience i advice providing more varied flights.json
2. Data manipulating of duration wrote in iso8601 should be done on backend, we assume with the provided algoritm that it is in seconds only
3. Currency provided in json is only "euro" but for more advanced website we would simply extend data/currencies file

### Instalation

In order for website to call api properly create ".env.local" file with variable called:
"REACT_APP_API_URL" and assign base url that we will be using (in this exercise scenario it would be "http://localhost:3001")

### Finishing Throughts

I really enjoyed this project simply because of its topic however I would like to get more designs or icons.
It is not that important but gives more filling to website that normally I add to task.
In few words it makes job easier to polish in already time consuming task.
Thank you for checking my variation of this project!
